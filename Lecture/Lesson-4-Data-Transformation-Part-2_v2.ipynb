    "## Lesson 4: Data Transformation with dplyr - Part 2 (Mutate, Summarize, Group By)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Lesson 4! In Part 1, you learned how to **select**, **filter**, and **arrange** your data — the tools for *finding* the right data. Now we'll learn the tools for *calculating* with your data. These are the functions that turn raw transactions into the reports, dashboards, and KPIs that businesses actually use to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What Will You Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of these new tools like working with a spreadsheet:\n",
    "- 🧮 **Mutate** = Adding a new formula column in Excel (e.g., Total = Price × Quantity)\n",
    "- 📊 **Summarize** = Using SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT at the bottom of a spreadsheet\n",
    "- 📂 **Group By** = Creating a Pivot Table that breaks data down by category\n",

    "| Transformation | Real-World Analogy | R Function |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------------|------------|\n",
    "| Adding a calculated column | Writing a formula in a new Excel column | `mutate()` |\n",
    "| Getting totals and averages | The \"Summary\" row at the bottom of a report | `summarize()` |\n",

    "### 💼 Why Do Business Analysts Need These Tools?\n",

    "| \"Flag any orders over $500 for review\" | Create a TRUE/FALSE column based on a condition | `mutate()` |\n",
    "| \"What was our average sale this quarter?\" | Collapse all rows into one summary number | `summarize()` |\n",
    "| \"How do our regions compare?\" | Get separate summaries for each region | `group_by() + summarize()` |\n",
    "| \"Which department has the most orders?\" | Count rows by category | `count()` |\n",

    "my_data <- data.frame(\n",
    "  CustomerID = c(1, 1, 2, 3),                          # Numbers, can repeat\n",

    "**💡 Tips:**\n",
    "- Each column must have the same number of values\n",
    "- CustomerID can repeat (one customer, multiple purchases)\n",
    "- Text values need quotes: `\"like this\"`\n",
    "- Numbers don't need quotes: `123`\n",
